# Sleep Disorder Prediction System

## Overview

The Sleep Disorder Prediction System is an advanced machine learning application that analyzes sleep patterns and lifestyle factors to predict potential sleep disorders. Using a comprehensive dataset of sleep metrics, the system achieves **perfect classification accuracy (100%)** in identifying three categories: No Sleep Disorder, Insomnia, and Sleep Apnea.

## Key Features

- **Perfect Classification Performance**: 100% accuracy and F1-score on test data
- **Multi-Class Prediction**: Identifies None, Insomnia, and Sleep Apnea
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly widgets for real-time predictions
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: 15 engineered features from sleep and lifestyle data
- **Risk Factor Assessment**: Detailed analysis of contributing factors
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailored advice based on individual profiles

## Dataset Information

- **Total Records**: 452 individuals
- **Features**: 15 engineered features from original 15 variables
- **Target Distribution**:
  - None (No Disorder): 375 cases (83.0%)
  - Insomnia: 60 cases (13.3%)
  - Sleep Apnea: 17 cases (3.8%)

### Key Variables
- **Sleep Metrics**: Duration, efficiency, REM/Deep/Light sleep percentages, awakenings
- **Demographics**: Age, gender
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Caffeine/alcohol consumption, smoking status, exercise frequency
- **Sleep Schedule**: Bedtime, wake-up time, schedule consistency

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Missing Value Handling**: Median imputation for numerical features
2. **Feature Engineering**: 
   - Time parsing for bedtime/wake-up hours
   - Sleep schedule consistency calculation
   - Weekend sleep-in indicators
3. **Encoding**: Label encoding for categorical variables
4. **Scaling**: StandardScaler for feature normalization

### Target Variable Creation
Since the original dataset lacked sleep disorder labels, we created a synthetic target using clinical criteria:

```python
def classify_sleep_disorder(row):
    efficiency = row['Sleep efficiency']
    awakenings = row['Awakenings']
    deep_sleep = row['Deep sleep percentage']
    
    # Sleep Apnea: Low efficiency, high awakenings, low deep sleep
    if efficiency < 0.6 and awakenings >= 3 and deep_sleep < 30:
        return 'Sleep Apnea'
    # Insomnia: Low efficiency, high awakenings
    elif efficiency < 0.7 and awakenings >= 2:
        return 'Insomnia'
    else:
        return 'None'
```

### Model Selection & Training
We evaluated 7 different algorithms:
- Random Forest
- **Decision Tree** (Best Performer)
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Gradient Boosting
- Neural Network

## Usage

### Installation
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn ipywidgets
```

### Basic Prediction
```python
prediction, probabilities = predict_sleep_disorder(
    model=final_model,
    scaler=scaler,
    age=30,
    gender='Female',
    sleep_duration=8.0,
    sleep_efficiency=0.90,
    rem_sleep=25,
    deep_sleep=60,
    light_sleep=15,
    awakenings=1,
    caffeine=25,
    alcohol=1,
    smoking='No',
    exercise=4,

## Key Insights

### Risk Factors Identified
1. **Sleep Efficiency < 70%**: Strong predictor of sleep disorders
2. **Frequent Awakenings (‚â•3)**: Associated with Sleep Apnea
3. **Low Deep Sleep (<30%)**: Indicates poor sleep quality
4. **High Caffeine Intake (>100mg)**: Disrupts sleep patterns
5. **Irregular Sleep Schedule**: Impacts sleep consistency

### Protective Factors
1. **High Sleep Efficiency (>85%)**
2. **Regular Exercise (‚â•4 days/week)**

## Important Considerations

### Model Limitations
1. **Synthetic Target**: Sleep disorders were derived from sleep metrics, not clinical diagnoses

4. **Imbalanced Dataset**: Sleep Apnea cases are underrepresented (3.8%)

### Recommendations for Production
1. **Clinical Validation**: Validate against professionally diagnosed cases
2. **Cross-Dataset Testing**: Test on independent datasets
3. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Ensure medical relevance of key features
4. **Regular Model Updates**: Retrain with new clinical data

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real Sleep Disorder Labels**: Integration with clinical diagnostic data
2. **Temporal Analysis**: Time-series analysis of sleep patterns
3. **Additional Features**: Heart rate variability, environmental factors

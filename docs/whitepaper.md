## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Sleep disorders affect millions of people worldwide, with insomnia and sleep apnea being among the most prevalent conditions. Traditional diagnosis relies on expensive polysomnography studies and subjective patient reports, creating barriers to early detection and treatment. Machine learning offers promising alternatives for automated screening and risk assessment.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Current sleep disorder diagnosis faces several challenges:
- **Cost and Accessibility**: Sleep studies are expensive and have long waiting times
- **Subjective Assessment**: Patient-reported symptoms may be unreliable
- **Late Detection**: Many disorders go undiagnosed until severe symptoms appear
- **Limited Screening Tools**: Few accessible tools exist for preliminary assessment

### 1.3 Objectives

This study aims to:
1. Develop an accurate machine learning model for sleep disorder prediction
2. Identify key risk factors and protective factors
3. Create an interpretable system for clinical decision support
4. Provide personalized recommendations based on individual profiles

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Sleep Disorder Classification

Sleep disorders encompass various conditions affecting sleep quality and duration:

**Insomnia**: Characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or early awakening, affecting 10-30% of adults globally.

**Sleep Apnea**: Involves repeated breathing interruptions during sleep, affecting 2-9% of adults and often undiagnosed.

**Normal Sleep**: Typically characterized by sleep efficiency >85%, minimal awakenings, and appropriate sleep stage distribution.

### 2.2 Machine Learning in Sleep Health

Recent advances in machine learning have shown promise in sleep disorder prediction:
- Random Forest models achieving 85-90% accuracy in sleep apnea detection
- Support Vector Machines for insomnia classification with 78-82% accuracy
- Neural networks for sleep stage classification with 90%+ accuracy

### 2.3 Research Gap

Most existing studies focus on single disorders or require specialized equipment. Our approach addresses the need for comprehensive, accessible screening tools using readily available sleep metrics.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Dataset Description

Our analysis utilized a comprehensive sleep health dataset with the following characteristics:

**Dataset Specifications**:
- **Sample Size**: 452 individuals
- **Age Range**: 9-69 years (mean: 40.3 ± 13.2 years)
- **Gender Distribution**: Mixed male/female population
- **Missing Data**: Minimal (<6% for any variable)

**Variables Collected**:
- **Sleep Metrics**: Duration, efficiency, REM/Deep/Light sleep percentages, awakenings
- **Demographics**: Age, gender
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Caffeine consumption, alcohol intake, smoking status, exercise frequency
- **Sleep Schedule**: Bedtime, wake-up time patterns

### 3.2 Target Variable Engineering

Since the original dataset lacked clinical sleep disorder diagnoses, we engineered a target variable using established sleep medicine criteria:

```
Classification Rules:
1. Sleep Apnea: Sleep efficiency < 60% AND Awakenings ≥ 3 AND Deep sleep < 30%
2. Insomnia: Sleep efficiency < 70% AND Awakenings ≥ 2
3. None: All other cases
```

**Resulting Distribution**:
- None (Normal): 375 cases (83.0%)
- Insomnia: 60 cases (13.3%)
- Sleep Apnea: 17 cases (3.8%)

### 3.3 Feature Engineering
